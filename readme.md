### Final Project Idea

- **Car Public Documentation Example Workflow**

  1. Each vehicle will have it's own key with information and it will be registered within the car's computer.

  2. Makers, sellers, mechanics and others will be able to register important information regarding the vehicle's title, accidents, mileage, etc.



- **TBD**
  1. Define how to prevent anyone from appending data to the car's key.
  2. Define what kind of information should it contain since all info is public.
